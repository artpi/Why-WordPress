# Why-WordPress
Arguments to use for convincing prospective client that He/She should go with WordPress as a platform

**TLDR: **[WHY?](./EN/WHY.md)

# Why
Have you ever had to create a presentation, document or a development plan in which you had to convince your (prospective) client to go with WordPress instead of Sharepoint / or (god forbid) `custom CMS built from scratch` ?

I had to, **many** times. 

**We all** know WordPress is awesome. But the client doesen't know that. All he heard were security concerns, that `Ghost` will kill WordPress, and so on.

I know, WordPress.org has a showcase site, where you can see all the beautifull website built with it, but the format is hard to include in presentations and documents.

# What is this?
This is a collection of arguments, presentations and documents to include into your own portfolio / development plan.

# Gimme!

[I started with basic arguments in English language.](./EN/WHY.md)

# Please Contribute!
This is a work in progress started a day before `Wordcamp Europe`. I hope this helps :).

I think it would be best to stick with Markdown format, but everything goes :)
Please, fork this repo and write!
