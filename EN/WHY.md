# WordPress is easy to maintain
There are many good WordPress developers, and the standards are well documented. 10 years from now it will not be a problem to implement a new feature on your website. 
Currently, there are 37,372 free plugins and on on of the theme marketplaces (themeforest.com) there are 5323 themes available.
If a need arises to add a functionality

## Everything is possible
Extensibility is at the core of WordPress. 
Most certainly, it is possible to accomodate your business needs, or any other website structure imaginable.

Everything possible in any other CMS can be also implemented in WordPress, but much easier.

# Building on top of WordPress is cheaper and faster

We like to focus on making your website stand out. Implementing base requirements will just take time and budget. WordPress provides extremely well-tested and robust foundation for your new spectacular website.

# WordPress is very well documented
[Codex.wordpress.com](http://codex.wordpress.com) provides an extensive documentation of every feature of WordPress. Additionally, [WordPress.tv](http://wordpress.tv/) provides video tutorials.

# WordPress is tested and secure
Bilions of people visit website built with WordPress. This kind of live test coverage is not easy to replicate.
More than 2000 people (TODO: reference needed) contributed to WordPress uncovering vulnerabilities and fixing bugs making it the most reviewed CMS in the world.

# WordPress is fixed really fast
Whenever a vulnerability or a bug is uncovered in WordPress, the community or Automattic (the company overseeing WordPress development) fixes it really fast (TODO: stats needed) and pushes an automatic update. Additional personnel is not needed, even years after website development.

Contrary, custom solutions lack 10 years of live tests on bilions of users. Even if vulnerability or a bug is identified, the solution has to be implemented.
